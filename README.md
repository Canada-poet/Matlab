## Velocity SAR 
Detect the velocity of moving target by SAR.

## PolSAR 
Decomposition (classification) of the PolSAR image. 4-component decomposition is a model-decomposition approach. And it
has been used for decade. Non-negative matrix factorization is kind of machine learning.

----------------------
* **PolSAR_AnalyzeTool.m**: is the class for PolSAR analysis, including Yamaguchi 4-component decomposition, eigen-decomposition, , pauli-decomposition and functions which calculate polarimetry parameters.
----------------------
* **SeaIce.m**: is the derived class from PolSAR_AnalyzeTool. This class is designed for sea-ice classification.
